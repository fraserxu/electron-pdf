### Install Electron

First, you need to install Electron. You can either run:

```
npm i -g electron-prebuilt
```

and then `electron` will be added to your path. Or, you can download a version from https://github.com/atom/electron/releases and then set an environment variable ELECTRON_PATH pointing to the binary. Note if you're using Mac OS X, the path would be to the actual executable and not the app directory e.g. `/Applications/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron.`

You should probably just install `electron-prebuilt` as it simplifies things.
